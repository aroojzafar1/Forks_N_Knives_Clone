Opening ZIP Files
Overview
This repository contains instructions and best practices for opening and extracting ZIP files. Whether you are dealing with project files, compressed datasets, or any other type of zipped content, this guide will help ensure you handle ZIP files correctly.

# Important: Unzipping Files

Extract All Files: Do not run or edit files directly from the ZIP archive. Extract all files to a directory on your local machine first.

Maintain Directory Structure: Make sure the folder structure remains intact. Altering the directory layout may cause the project or files to malfunction.

Avoid Special Characters: Use a folder path without special characters or spaces to prevent potential issues.

How to Unzip

Windows:

Right-click the ZIP file.

Select "Extract All...".

Choose a destination folder and click "Extract".

macOS:

Double-click the ZIP file.

The files will be automatically extracted to the same location as the ZIP file.

Linux:

Open a terminal.

Use the command unzip yourfile.zip to extract the files.

Troubleshooting

Corrupted Files: If you encounter errors, ensure the ZIP file was downloaded completely and try downloading again.

Missing Files: Ensure all files are extracted and that the directory structure is preserved.
